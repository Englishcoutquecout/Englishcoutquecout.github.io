    <p>Hey guys, I'm so happy to introdure myself to you. I'm a convert, i was baptize when i was 18 years old on the 3rd of may 2015. I served a full time mission in Ghana Kumassi mission (West Africa). 
        <p> I was studying business management BS but I decided to change my major to Apply technology this semester because I believe this major will best help me reach my goals as a business owner. As a typical Ivoirien, I like eating a food called"Placily" with palm nut soup.
            <p>  I never learn how to make African braiding hair but I'm very good at making African hair. That must be my talent or gift. What I like most about BYU-Idaho is the fact that students learn diverse principle which always links to their discipleship membership of Jesus Christ. I always find a way to connect with the spirit of god when I study. Since this world is returning to a digital world I believe, a technological career will definitely be in demand. I hope to learn programing and coding skills at the end of this course because I will like to use these skills to cross my small business.
